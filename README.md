This app uses as GUI library PyQt5. This is my graduation work project which has been created for 4 month. But this can be developed better. Project consist of 2 main application. One of them is for the Raspberry,Arduino and e to handle data from main application and process on the data and send it back to main program. The second and main one support Linux and Windows. It connects the local radio module and send datas to remote ones and wait for their response (works with one remore node in exact time). And get the temperature (thing we get from remote node is temperature, just for our purpose, can be modified for other sensors and processes) and in the end the graphic pops out for user to check temperature up-downs. Because of temperature sensor library (DHT-11 , Ada-fruit python library for DHT-11,DHT-12) its take 2 second to sense the temperature in program 5 seconds temperature monitoring takes 10 second.And there is other few nuances too. But Free to develope.
